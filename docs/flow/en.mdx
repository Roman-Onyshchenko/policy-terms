### The general application process is as follows:

1. **Select your native language and the language you wish to learn**

2. **Add a new word (for regular users) or phrase (for Premium users) to your Dictionary**
   ![Description](/flow/assets/dictionary_en.jpg)

**You can add words/phrases to the dictionary in three ways:**

- By tapping the icon and entering the word or phrase to get the translation

- By sharing a word or phrase from another app on your device and getting the translation

3. **Learning words and phrases**

   Once you have added enough words or phrases to your dictionary, you can start learning them on the Learning page. By default, translations of the added words or phrases are hidden and grayed out. To reveal the translations, you can either tap each one individually or show them all at once by tapping the corresponding icon:

   To reinforce your learning, you can switch to Learning mode and match words or phrases with their translations.

   Two types of learning are available:

   - **Drop-down list**: Choose the number of drop-down options in the settings and try to select the correct answer for each word or phrase.

   - **Drag and drop**: Tap and hold the drag icon, then move the selected translation to match the word or phrase. Once released, the translation will be paired with the word or phrase, and any previous pairings will be swapped.

4. **Training**
   After a successful learning session, if you're feeling confident, you can test your knowledge on the Training page. There are two types of training available (with or without a timer):

   - **Choose from options**: Select the correct translation from four options. For this training type, you have up to three attempts to get the correct answer.

   - **Match pairs**: Drag and match the word or phrase with its correct translation by selecting from four options in each column. You have up to three attempts to complete the correct pairings.

   - **True or false**: Simply decide if the translation presented is correct for the word or phrase.

   - **Match pairs (drag and drop)**: Like in the learning mode, drag and drop to pair words or phrases with their correct translations.

   - **Flip cards**: Enter the correct translation for each word or phrase and press the check button. Be careful, as the case of letters matters.

   **Note: If you answer incorrectly, the word or phrase is more likely to appear in future training sessions, helping you better memorize it.**

5. **View statistics**
   After completing your training session, you can review your results on the Statistics page. For each training session, you can see your correct and incorrect answers, the date, the translation direction, and more.

6. **Home Page Sections**
   On the home page, the following sections are available:

   - **Word of the Day**: A randomly selected word or phrase from your dictionary, with the option to hear the pronunciation of the word/phrase and its translation.
