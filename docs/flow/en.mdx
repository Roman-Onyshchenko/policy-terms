### The general application process is as follows:

1. **Select your native language and the language you wish to learn**
   ![Description](/flow/assets/add_lang_pair_en.jpg)

2. **Add a new word (for regular users) or phrase (for Premium users) to your Dictionary**
   ![Description](/flow/assets/dictionary_en.jpg)

**You can add words/phrases to the dictionary in three ways:**

- By tapping the icon and entering the word or phrase to get the translation
  ![Description](/flow/assets/word_translate_en.jpg)
  ![Description](/flow/assets/phrase_translate_en.jpg)

- By uploading an Excel file with a list of words or phrases
  ![Description](/flow/assets/import_excel_en.jpg)

  Before uploading the excel document, make sure that the names of the columns look like this:
  ![Description](/flow/assets/excel_format.png)

  **Also, pay attention to the current translation direction and make sure that you download the Excel file specifically for it.**

- By sharing a word or phrase from another app on your device and getting the translation (Available to Premium users)

  To make it easier to choose the most correct translation, an indicator is available under the word, if it is completely filled in, then the translation is the most accurate:

  When translating phrases or adding your own translation, these translations are marked with the word "Premium":

  For many languages, the "Text to Speech" service is available, which is activated in the Dictionary by clicking on the icon:

  We apologize if the Text to Speech service may not work for your language. If at least one language (native or the language you are learning) is supported, then the word or phrase will be voiced.

**You can also delete a word/phrase in two ways:**

- finger gesture to the left:

- or by clicking on the basket icon. In this case, you will need to confirm the intention to delete:

3. **Learning words and phrases**

   Once you have added enough words or phrases to your dictionary, you can start learning them on the Learning page. By default, translations of the added words or phrases are hidden and grayed out. To reveal the translations, you can either tap each one individually or show them all at once by tapping the corresponding icon:

   To reinforce your learning, you can switch to Learning mode and match words or phrases with their translations.

   Two types of learning are available:

   - **Drop-down list**: Choose the number of drop-down options in the settings and try to select the correct answer for each word or phrase.
     ![Description](/flow/assets/learning_dropdown_en.jpg)

   - **Drag and drop**: Tap and hold the drag icon, then move the selected translation to match the word or phrase. Once released, the translation will be paired with the word or phrase, and any previous pairings will be swapped.

**Please note:** you can end the Learning at any time and in this case the percentage of correct answers is deducted from the number of questions answered during the Learning.

4. **Training**

   After a successful learning session, if you're feeling confident, you can test your knowledge on the Training page. There are two types of training available (with or without a timer):

   - **Choose from options**: Select the correct translation from four options. For this training type, you have up to three attempts to get the correct answer.
     ![Description](/flow/assets/training_choose_from_en.jpg)

   - **Match pairs**: Drag and match the word or phrase with its correct translation by selecting from four options in each column. You have up to three attempts to complete the correct pairings.
     ![Description](/flow/assets/training_choose_pair_en.jpg)

   - **True or false**: Simply decide if the translation presented is correct for the word or phrase.
     ![Description](/flow/assets/training_true_false_en.jpg)

   - **Match pairs (drag and drop)**: Like in the learning mode, drag and drop to pair words or phrases with their correct translations.
     ![Description](/flow/assets/match_pairs_training.gif)

   - **Flip cards**: Enter the correct translation for each word or phrase and press the check button. Be careful, as the case of letters matters.
     ![Description](/flow/assets/training_flip_cards_en.jpg)

   **Note:**

   - If you answer incorrectly, the word or phrase is more likely to appear in future training sessions, helping you better memorize it.
   - You can end the Training at any time and in this case the percentage of correct answers is deducted from the number of questions answered during the Training.

5. **View statistics**

   After completing your training session, you can review your results on the Statistics page. For each training session, you can see your correct and incorrect answers, the date, the translation direction, and more.

   - **Word of the Day**: A randomly selected word or phrase from your dictionary, with the option to hear the pronunciation of the word/phrase and its translation.
